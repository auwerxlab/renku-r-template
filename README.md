# renku-r-template

This is a bare R project template that can be directly imported in [Renku](https://datascience.ch/renku).

## Environment

This is an R project and the ``.Rproj`` file is located in the main directory.

The entire environment required for this project is described in the ``Dockerfile`` located in the main directory.
It allows to generate a docker image that runs an instance of R Studio server in which the R project can be open.

### Python dependencies

The required dependencies are listed in the ``requirements.txt`` file located in the main directory.

## Importing in Renku

1. Go to `GitLab` -> `New Project` -> `Import Project` -> `Repo by URL`
2. Fill-in the essential fields:
  - Git repository URL: https://github.com/auwerxlab/renku-r-template.git
  - Project name: <your project name>
  - Project slug: <your project slug>
3. Click on `Create Project`.
4. In your new project, update this README.md file with an appropriate description and commit your changes. You will find below a template for this.
5. After completing a first commit, the project interactive environment gets accessible in the Renku UI.
