# renku-r-template

This is a bare R project template that can be directly imported in [Renku](https://datascience.ch/renku). \
(See the *Importing in Renku* section below)

## Environment

This is an R project and the ``.Rproj`` file is located in the main directory.

The entire environment required for this project is described in the ``Dockerfile`` located in the main directory. \
It allows to generate a docker image that runs an instance of R Studio server in which the R project can be open.

You can change the R version that will be installed on the docker image by editing the ``FROM`` statement that specifies a base image in the ``Dockerfile``:

```
FROM renku/renkulab-r:4.0.0-renku0.10.4-0.6.3
```

A list of available base images can be found at https://hub.docker.com/r/renku/renkulab-r/tags. \
Chose one with the R version you want. For example, for R 3.6.2, you can chose the *3.6.2-renku0.10.4-0.6.3* image. \
Don't forget to also update the R version in the ``renv.lock`` file (see the *R dependencies* section below).

### R dependencies

This project uses the [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) R package to manage R packages dependencies. \
The ``renv.lock`` file is located in the main directory.

Renv has been set to install R packages on this project's docker image. \
Therefore, the ``renv/`` directory in the main directory of this project has been set as a symbolic link to the renv library located on the docker image, in the ``/home/rstudio`` directory. \
To change this behavior, edit the ``install.R`` file located in the main directory. Don't forget to also change the ``renv`` link into an actual ``renv/`` directory.

The prefered way to install additional R packages and manage them with renv is to use the ``install.packages()``
command within an R session and to update the ``renv.lock`` file using the ``renv::snapshot(type="all")`` command. \
As alternatives, you could :
1. directly edit the ``renv.lock`` file - ‚ö†Ô∏è be sure to know what you are doing though. \
OR
2. add the ``install.packages()`` command to the ``install.R`` file. However, this will not update the project's ``renv.lock`` file unless you use ``renv::snapshot()`` in an R session.

‚ö†Ô∏è If using Renku, whatever you do, don't forget to commit and push your changes to save them. ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Python dependencies

The required python packages can be listed in the ``requirements.txt`` file located in the main directory. \
They will be installed on the docker image with ``pip3`` (see the ``Dockerfile`` in the main directory).

## Importing in Renku

1. Go to `GitLab` -> `New Project` -> `Import Project` -> `Repo by URL`
2. Fill-in the essential fields:
  * Git repository URL: https://github.com/auwerxlab/renku-r-template.git
  * Project name: *your-project-name*
  * Project slug: *your-project-slug*
3. Click on `Create Project`.
4. In your new project, update this README.md file with an appropriate description and commit your changes.
  You will find a template for this purpose in the *README.md template* section below. \
  Also consider adding an appropriate license to the project.
5. After completing a first commit, the project interactive environment gets accessible in the Renku UI.

üëç That's it!
